# View Your Times

*What's going on in the world today*

Using React, Redux and the NYT top stories public API, we gather news from around the world and display it using the Highmaps library. 

The heat map on our main page dynamically updates every day based on what the NYT is talking about. Hover over a country to see how many stories it appears in, and click on it to view each story in more detail. If you're really excited to read more, you can click through on the countries page to each NY Times article.

Please head to our deployed site to see it in action: <http://viewyourtimes.herokuapp.com/>
